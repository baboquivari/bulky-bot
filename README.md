# bulky-bot

A personal project that I embarked upon in order to improve my Node skills. 

BulkyBot is a way of managing daily protein/calorie intake. You text it protein/calories numbers, like this:

30.500 (30g Protein, 500 Cals)

... and then BulkyBot stores this in a Mongo DB and then responds with your daily totals.

The server integrates with my Twilio account (an SMS messaging service).
