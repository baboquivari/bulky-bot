BULKYBOT FLOW

I send 2 integers to my Twilio phone number
It sends a POST to an /SMS endpoint at my web server, hosted on Heroku.
My server then inputs these 2 integers into a MongoDB database, along with today's date.
Then it reads all the protein / calories values from today's date...
It uses this data to create a TWIML response, which sends a message back to the original phone number with a response like
	"Todays Totals: Protein: 78, Calories: 1400 - Keep it up!"

NON-MVP Stuff

- Implement a weekly update that gets sent to my phone number.
- Ask for images to store on a DB every week, so I can track my progress.
