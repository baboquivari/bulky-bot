Going to scrap having all this in a spreadsheet and am instead going to opt for storing and reading all my data from a MongoDB. This will help solidify my back end knowledge.

Been following this:

I'm up to CONNECTING TO THE DATABASE - subheading.

Installed Mongo on my machine. To run it:

1) Open Windows Prompt and type mongod
2) Open Git Bash and type mongo

---------------

THINK I'M GONNA HAVE TO SET UP MLABS TO PERSIST MY DATABASE ONLINE.
